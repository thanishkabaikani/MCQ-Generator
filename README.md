# 🧠 MCQ Generator with OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit

A smart **Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Generator** built using **OpenAI**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**. This tool allows users to generate MCQs from a given topic or content using advanced prompt engineering techniques and chaining methods like `SimpleChain` and `SequentialChain`. It also supports structured output in **JSON format** and maintains a **timeline log** for every interaction.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Input**: A topic or passage is entered into the Streamlit UI.
2. **LangChain Prompts**: Sequential chains are used to first extract key concepts, then generate MCQs from them.
3. **Output**: The MCQs are displayed in the UI, saved in a JSON format, and logged with a timestamp.
4. **Review**: An optional review/comment can be added for feedback or improvement.
